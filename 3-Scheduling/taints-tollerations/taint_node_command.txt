kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect ( noSchedule , PreferNoSchedule,  noExecute)
noSchedule --- > NoSchedule. This means that no pod will be able to schedule onto node-name unless it has a matching toleration
PreferNoSchedule --- > the system will try avoid schedule in the node but this is not guaranteed
noExecute --- > new pods will not schedule in the node
example :
# kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:noSchedule
# kubectl taint nodes controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule-
